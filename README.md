## What is Pomodoro?
Pomodoro is a technique used for time management. It's based on the idea that splitting up work with small breaks can reduce mental fatigue and improve overall productivity.

The Pomodoro Flow
1. Work on a task for 25 minutes
2. Take a short, 5 minute break
3. Repeat
4. On every 4th cycle, take a longer, 10 minute break
